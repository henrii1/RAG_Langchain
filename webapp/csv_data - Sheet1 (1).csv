,Therapist Speaks,Client Responds
0,How's everything going for you?,I'm not sure yet. I have to undergo a couple of surgeries soon.
1,What kind of surgeries are you having?,I need one for a bone issue and another for my upper back.
2,What happened to your back?,"I have a fracture, and two of my discs are misaligned."
3,That sounds painful?,It is. But I trust my surgeon. He's been with me for 10 years and he's honest. He doesn't exaggerate my issues just to make money.
4,Do you have good insurance coverage?,I'm figuring that out.
5,Sorry for my distraction earlier; I had a surgery last year. I just had something urgent to sort before this meeting. I know I missed our previous appointment; I apologize for that.,No worries.
6,"Speaking of appointments, don't you have one with a P.O?","No, I don't have a P.O. But I do have a court date coming up on August 9th. I'll be requesting a trial."
7,Have you been through this legal process before?,"No, this is my first time. It's just a misdemeanor, but I want my side to be heard."
8,What's the worst-case scenario with the trial?,"Honestly, I'm not sure. But I'm willing to face it head-on."
9,"Right, I remember our last discussion. You mentioned issues with trust and anger, especially with your sister.","My sister has had a tough life. But recently, she overstepped by telling my landlord to check my place for alcohol or drugs. It felt invasive, especially after all I've done for her."
10,How did she react when you confronted her?,It got physical. I ended up in jail.
11,I remember you mentioning something about bikers?,"Yes, I've been around bikers. But not all bikers are violent or aggressive. Many are genuinely good people. But yes, if you disrespect them, there will be consequences."
12,"I understand that. So, since our last meeting, how have you been coping?","Apart from the surgeries, I'm planning to move out of my current place by the end of the month. I might go to a hotel. I've just had enough."
13,Have you lived in a hotel before?,"Yes, and it was a positive experience."
14,"That's good to hear. Sometimes, getting a fresh start is what we need. Also, I recall you mentioning helping out at your current residence with supervised smoke breaks?","Yes, even though it's not my job, I ensure the smokers get their breaks. They rely on me for that. The staff is shorthanded, and I just felt the need to step in."
15,That's commendable. How old did you say your sister was again?,"I'm 54, and she's a couple of years older than me."
16,Do you feel any added stress taking on these additional responsibilities at your residence?,"Sometimes. It feels like a burden, but I also know it's the right thing to do. It gives me a sense of purpose."
17,"And regarding your sister, have you thought about establishing boundaries to avoid future confrontations?","I've thought about it, but implementing it is hard. Our relationship has always been complicated, and she doesn't always respect boundaries."
18,"Remember, it's essential for your well-being to establish and maintain those boundaries, especially given your current health challenges.",I know. It's just hard when it's family.
19,"I completely understand. Shifting gears a bit, is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or address in our sessions?","Yes, I'd like to work on my anger management. Sometimes I feel like my reactions are more aggressive than necessary. It's not just about my sister but in general. I've noticed it affecting other areas of my life too."
20,That's a constructive step forward. Recognizing the need for change is half the battle. We can certainly work on strategies to help you cope and respond differently.,"I'd appreciate that. I want to change, especially with everything else going on."
21,"It's commendable that you're taking these steps. Remember, it's a journey, and I'm here to support you through it. Speaking of journeys, have you found any hobbies or activities that help you relax and focus?",Not recently. But I used to love riding bikes. It was liberating.
22,Maybe you can consider taking it up again. It could be a therapeutic way to redirect your energy and emotions.,I'll think about it. Sounds like a good idea.
23,"It's all about finding balance and outlets. We'll continue working on strategies in our upcoming sessions. Remember, you're not alone in this journey.",Thank you. It means a lot to have someone to talk to about all this.
